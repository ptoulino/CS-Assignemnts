I have included a pdf of the dog-walking map named project_map.pdf that shows 
the different drop-off and pic-up locations available!
Hopefully you enjoy my project and see that everything is up to par! Thanks for the great semester
and all your help outside of class, I really appreciate it and think I learned a lot
in this class!

P.S. I edited my project model with you and noticed a mistake and just want to remind you that I meant a I to Many relationship in between customer and dog. I mistakenly put a Many to Many relationship in this model as we discussed during your office hours.
Also sent you an email about this titled CS 325 Project(Design note).

Thanks again!
Philip
