Now fully implemented our database offers features to grooming services across
the greater Arcata area.
Within this database one will be allowed access to store employee id numbers, 
salary information and other critical information to run a successful business
and keep track of what personal should be doing. The customer will be allowed 
to choose whether or not they have any special requests for the groomer such as
washing/grooming. Our database allows storage of information that is critical to
run a business such as customer information and whether or not they have an 
optional tab open and have payments due. Each customer has an identification 
number as well as there dog for easy knowledge of what each dog's schedule is 
for the day including their appointment times, identification numbers, and their 
drop-off and pick-up location!

We encourage our customers to take advantage of these features and set your 
drop off location in whatever part of the city is most convenient for you! 
Within our database we offer to keep track of your employee's salary, rates
all thanks to a special employee identification number they have that will
make it easy to keep track of which employee is on walking or washing 
which dog. More applications within the database are completely possible,
such as adding more customer identification numbers and employee 
identification numbers and linking these within a different
application such as a mobile application. Our database management 
system serves as an efficient handler to balance the different 
needs of diverse applications that are using the same data.

Hopefully all these features will help a small business grow and expand 
and additionally allow all the employees to be accountable for each dog
they handle as each customer can have the ability to know what route 
they are taking and hopefully in the long run becoming the best walking service in Arcata!
